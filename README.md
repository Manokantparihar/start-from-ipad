My developer journey starts today 🚀

## Analysis
- Single-page landing that markets Manomaya with hero, trust stats, pricing, and CTA.
- Interactive “Build a learning kit” form feeds `index.js` to update live preview text and instructor line.
- Template tiles share a background image set from the `templates` map; randomize via “List a resource”.
- CTA buttons scroll to the builder section; copy action writes the formatted outline to the clipboard.
- No build tooling or automated tests; page runs as static HTML/CSS/JS.
